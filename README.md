Hi everyone!
I'm Valentina but you can call me **Rorra** :)

I'm a **Product Designer Intern** and a **Full Stack Development** student.

I speak **Portuguese**, **Spanish** and **English** and I love connecting with people from all over the world!

My goals:
- Grow as a full stack developer
- Contribute to open source projects
- Keep learning and sharing knowledge

Let’s connect!
Feel free to check out my repos or reach out for collaboration or learning together.
